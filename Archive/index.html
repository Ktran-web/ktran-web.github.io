    <h1>Welcome to Bino</h1>
    <p><center>Welcome to Bino Art
        I am an artist who has been working on refining his skills for over 15 years, I have done hundreds of freelance commissions for customers and currently working on diving into the world of animation!
        What fascinates me about art is that you can take anything you imagine, and merge that with the world in front of you. I see it as a way to season your visual stimuli, needless to say I donâ€™t think I would be getting over drawing any time soon!
