I have many styles I like to work on I prefer drawing people in a semi realistic way. One of my biggest inspirations is an artist that goes by the name of Caravaggio which is someone I try to take after in my art, but maybe in a more lighthearted way.

I have plenty of art, and plenty of styles to look over!
